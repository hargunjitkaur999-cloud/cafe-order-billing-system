☕ Python Cafe Management System
Cafe Billing System is a Python-program inspired by the day-to-day operations of a cozy café. From welcoming customers to taking their orders, the program is about a smooth café experience by displaying a menu, 
accepting multiple item selections, and generating a clear order summary with the final bill amount.Designed with simplicity and usability in mind, the system ensures a friendly interaction by validating item 
availability and handling user input efficiently. Behind the scenes, core Python concepts such as dictionaries, loops, and conditional logic work together to manage menu items and calculate bills accurately.
This project is perfect for beginners who want to learn Python through a real-life café scenario. It serves as a strong foundation for building more advanced café management features like quantity handling, 
discounts, digital receipts, and payment options.
Whether you’re a student exploring Python or someone who loves blending code with creativity, this project brings the charm of a café into a simple yet functional billing system .
